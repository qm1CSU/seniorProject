This project is a web application (“web app”) that will serve as an inventory management system for a small business, with the primary purpose of keeping track of products in stock. The web app will include the following three major components:

Tier 1 (Presentation): The client-facing application that allows a user to interact with the database and contains information about the type and quantity of products in stock, for example  

Tier 2 (Application): The logic that allows the web-based program to create, read, update, or delete information in the database

Tier 3 (Storage): Consists of a relational database with attributes to include, but not limited to, “product code,” “product type,” “quantity in stock,” and “price”
